    <h3 style="font-size: large; color: #f38181; text-align: center;">But what if you realise your child is a cyberbully?</h3>

        <p style="font-size: large; color: #f38181;">Like traditional forms of bullying, it is important to get to the root cause of the behaviour, said experts.  Parents should also explain to their children the impact of their bullying on themselves and their victims.</p> 
        
        <p style="font-size: large; color: #f38181;">Singapore Children’s Society Ms Ann said: “Bullying not only affects victims but the bullies as well. There has been much research indicating that if left unsupported, some bullies may engage in aggressive behaviours in adulthood, have impaired social skills and relationships, or even experience depression and suicide.”</p>
        
        <p style="font-size: large; color: #f38181;">Added Prof Lim of SMU: “With cyberbullying, sometimes bullies think that it is not going to have any physical kind of damage as it is just an image or a few words on the Internet. So it is important to elicit a sense of empathy in the bully to explain that their actions can inflict lasting damage on the victim.”</p>

    <b></b>
    <p style="font-size: large; color: #f38181;">Left unaddressed, flaming can be dangerous and have serious consequences. It’s up to adults to intervene when minors are involved. At the beginning stages of a flame war, you may be able to simply leave the conversation or block the offending party or parties. However, once multiple individuals have become involved, it’s often more difficult to end a flame war.</p>
