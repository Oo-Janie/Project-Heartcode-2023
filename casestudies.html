    <p class="text-center" style="font-size: large; color: maroon">Ms Erin Seah</p>
    <div class="text-center">
        <img class="rounded-4" src="https://www.ruay365.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/cyber-bullying.jpg" style="height: 300px; width: 500px;">

        Having distanced herself from a close female friend after a falling out, Ms Erin Seah, then 15, thought that she could move on.

        Then one night, her phone buzzed - a mutual friend sent a slew of screenshots from an Instagram post where she was called, among other things, attention-seeking and dumb.Ms Seah recalled the horror of learning about the post which had vulgarities and veiled threats of violence targeted towards her. Her friend-turned-bully wrote: “I swear … I WILL break my no detention record in school since Secondary 1 for the sake of just one punch to give it to ya.”

        While her name was not mentioned in the post, a comment confirmed her doubts. “You are talking about E**n, right,” read the comment in a screenshot Ms Seah showed TODAY.
        
        What started the torrent of online abuse? It was over the same mutual friend that had sent her the screenshots - Ms Seah had rejected his feelings, and her bully took it personally.
        
        “She thought I was taking advantage of him for not reciprocating his feelings, and that I was attention-seeking,” Ms Seah recalled of her bully.
        
        Although about six years have passed since the cyberbullying took place, Ms Seah, now 21, told TODAY that she has yet to put the traumatic episode fully behind her.
        <br><br>
        For Ms Seah, she also did not do anything about the cyberbullying - until her mother found out about it. 

            While the then-teenager knew that her ex-friend had been one of the cyberbullies, the other comments on the Instagram post were made using accounts that she could not identify. Coupled with bullying physically in school - such as threats of violence and mean comments - and the online death threats, Ms Seah started ostracising herself from others for her safety.
            
            “I would go to the toilet when there was not a teacher in class, and immediately run back home when the bell rang so that I could not be attacked,” she said. The fears led to her skipping school for a week with the excuse of not feeling well.
        <br><br>
        “It was uncharacteristic of me (to skip school), but the bullying took a toll on me. My mum recognised that something was wrong, so she pushed for an answer and was obviously upset.”

                Her mother went to the school to make a complaint but was stopped from making a police report by Ms Seah and her teachers. However, the bullying - both online and in the real world - continued and it only ended when Ms Seah completed secondary school about a year later.
                
                Like other victims of cyberbullying who spoke to TODAY, Ms Seah still struggles with its effects.
                
                The lingering aftermath is something experts said requires a more in-depth examination in Singapore, given that cyberbullying can be more vicious than its traditional forms: It is often archived on the Internet, and has a 24/7 presence in victims’ lives.

        Creme De La Creme contestant Ean Cheong found himself to be the target of cyberbullying after the latest episode of the Mediacorp baking competition aired on Jun 23 on Channel 8.
        
        It all began when the four semi-finalists – Cheong, Angie Lim, Shawn Pang and Yeo Min – were tasked to replicate judge and dessert maestro Janice Wong's strawberry tart.zz
        <br><br>In the midst of his hustle, Cheong mistakenly used Lim’s mousse base for his tart.

            Cheong apologised, and both he and Lim agreed to use each other’s mousse – even though the judges allowed them to remake the component.
            
            As it turned out, Lim’s tart caused her to be eliminated from the competition as the mousse base – made by Cheong – was found to contain pieces of cling wrap by veteran actresses and judges Fann Wong and Jeanette Aw. <br><br>
            During the episode, Wong commented that "with the cling wrap, it was a foregone conclusion".

                Aw agreed that "it was a blunder that should never have been made. It shouldn't have happened". <br><br>
            Guest judge Then Chui Foong said that the presence of cling wrap can crop up when the mousse is not spread evenly on the cling wrap and removed after freezing.

                Although Lim did not blame Cheong for the elimination, viewers felt differently about the judges’ decision. <br><br>
            Those who took to social media to air their displeasure felt that it was unfair to Lim, especially when the judges acknowledged the mix-up. Comments flooded Channel 8's as well as the actresses' Instagram accounts, with many decrying their decisions. <br><br>
            Cheong was also targeted in the online vitriol, making him upload a now-deleted three-part Instagram post, in which he said he would return his trophy and certificate "as the most undeserving finalist in many people's eyes”.

                “I’m sorry if the outcome of the decision did not turn out the way many of you wished for,” he wrote, revealing that from the show's very first episode, he had been receiving negative comments such as "shameless".
                
                He added at the end that he didn't sign up for the competition for the title or trophy, but for "the knowledge of doing more pastry".
