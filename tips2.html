    <h3 style="color: #f38181; text-align: center;">Steps to take if you are being flamed on the Internet:</h3>
    <ol style="color: #f38181; font-size: large;">
        <li>If you can, reach out to the instigators to find a resolution/block them from further posting.</li>
        <li>Always be polite on the Internet. Do not be rude to the other party.</li>
        <li>Acknowledge the truths. Most online rants are tied to at least a seed of truth. Ensure sure you are honest about those points.
            Fix what you can. Nothing diffuses a nasty situation faster than solving the problem.</li>
            <li>Be open to different solutions. Different situations and different people call for different approaches. Sometimes you have to sit down and join them in conversation. Sometimes you have to laugh.</li>
            <li>Know when to move on. Sometimes, the best thing to do is not engage them at all, or to end a conversation. Do not be afraid to do the same online. </li>
    </ol>
