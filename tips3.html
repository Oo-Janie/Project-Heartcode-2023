    <ol style="color: #f38181; font-size: large;">
        <li>Take a step back. Do not rush to stand up for the person being flamed, especially when you are angry.</li>
        <li>Hear the victim out. Lend a listening ear to get a sense of how they are coping with the aggression towards them.</li>
            <li>If the victim requires your help, discuss and find different solutions. Different situations and different people call for different approaches. Sometimes you have to sit down and join them in conversation. Sometimes you have to laugh.</li>
            <li>Let the victim know when to move on. Sometimes, the best thing to do is to not engage the aggressor at all. This can prevent further conflict.</li>
    </ol>
